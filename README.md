Skele is an architectural framework that assists building
**data-driven** apps with **[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)** or
**[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)**.
It is extremely well-suited for creating highly **dynamic UIs**,
that are driven by back-end systems (like Content Management Systems).
